css was introduced by hakon wium lie. css stands for cascading style sheet . it is used to style html page.
in 1995 w3c accept hakon idea  and css comes they accept the idea and start working and thinking about css properties
in 1996 they introduced first version of CSS1 due to lack of feature after 2 years (1998) they introduced new version CSS2 

*2011: CSS3 begins to roll out as a collection of modular specifications, enabling advanced styling and interactivity.
2020s: CSS4 is in development, poised to bring even more advanced features to the world of web design.

from 1999 they start working on css and after 12 years in 2011 they launched
current version is CSS.3 


*for id = #
*for class = .
*first html then css then javascript 
*****there are two principles 1- dry (do not repeat yourself), 2- soc(seperation of concern (seperate each and everything (html,css.js)
- it will help increase development speed)

*three ways to give CSS:-
1- inline css-  is a method of applying styling directly to individual HTML elements using the “style” attribute
  to provide inline CSS we use style attribute in opening tag
    drawbacks- time consuming , reducing code readibility thats why they introduce internal css
2- internal css - Internal or Embedded CSS is defined within the HTML document’s using <style> tag. 
It applies styles to specified HTML elements. we will provide internal css inside head tag.
drawback- it will create conflict , increase code readibility
3- external css -External CSS contains separate CSS files (style.css) that contain only style properties with the help of tag attributes.
  to connect css file we use link tag (link:css).

  **first prioroty is constant i.e inline css ,  second - external , third - internal (distance matter) 
  (external and internal priority depends),it depends whether we write link tag first or style tag it will go according to this. 


  syntax for css is:-
  selector(id,class) {
                        property:value ex- (color: ;
                         bg color:  ;
  }

  selector - to select a particular html element 
  types of selector:-there are 5 types of selector in css,
  1- simple selector
  2- combinator selector
  3- attribute selector - we can target element using attribute name also and  along with there value also 
  4- pseudo class selector- it is used to define a special state of  element. 
  there is one more pseudo class  :has tag.
  for this we have single : colon
    
    types :-
    1- dynamic pseudo classes                2- UI element pseudo classes                3- structural pseudo classes
    a- linked (blue)                                  a- enabled                                   a-first child
    b- active (red)                                  b- disabled                                   b-last child
    c- visited (purple)                               c-  check                                    c-Nth-child()
    d- focus                                                                                      d- first-of-type
    e- hover                                                                                      e- last-of-type
  ** in tables if we want to give color to odd and even cells then we use nth child {ex- p:nth-child(odd)}
5 - pseudo element selector- it is used to style specified part of an element.
it has :: double colon
some pseudo elements are:-
::first-line
::first-letter
::before
::after
::marker to style bullets number alphabets
::selection - for selecting the content and style them

1- simple selector: 
  a- id selector: (# )should be unique and for uniquely targeting
  b- class selector: (.) to target multiple element , it can have same class name 
  c- tag / element selector: with the help of tag name we will select
  d- universal selector:(*)selector can also select all elements if we want to give same style to whole html tags we use universal selector
  to remove the default space which is in browser , we use universal selector
  e- grouping selector:The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
  whenever we want to give styling to multiple element then we make a grp of element
  ex- h1, h2, p{
               }
  It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.
  To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
  we can use there class name or tag name or id name
   priority of these tags (id> class>tag >universal) 

   2-combinator selector : it will work on the relationship ,  with the help of combinator selector 
   we can target any element based on thier relationship between the element
   we have 4 types :
   1- descendent selector
   2- child selector
   3- general sibling selector
   4- adjacent sibling selector

   1- descendent selector:- symbol of DS is space. we target the elements based on there ancestor.
   2- child selector:- it select all element that are children of specific element. symbol is > we will take reference from immediate parent
   3- general sibling selector - symbol is ~ - The general sibling selector selects all elements 
   that are next siblings of a specified element. (div ~ li)
   4- adjacent sibling selector - symbol is + - The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element 
   that is directly after another specific element. (div + li).
